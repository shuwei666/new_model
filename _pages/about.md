I am a third year Ph.D. candidate supervised by [Prof. Minchen(Tommy) Wei](https://www.polyucolorlab.com/leader.html). My main research interests now are centered in color science related to 2D and 3D vision. Currently, I am focusing on the following topics:

- Color constancy in challenging scenarios, such as pure color scenes, cross-sensor applications, and multi-illumination scenes.
- Tone mapping/Gamut mapping.
- AI ISP
- Color vision for AR/VR/MR
- Machine learning and GenAI.
