I am a Ph.D supervised by [Prof. Minchen(Tommy) Wei](https://www.polyucolorlab.com/leader.html). My main research interests now are centered in color science related to 2D and 3D vision. Currently, I am focusing on the following topics:

- Color constancy.
- HDR/Tone mapping/Gamut mapping.
- AI ISP.
- Machine learning and GenAI.
