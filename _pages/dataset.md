## 2. Single-illuminant dataset: Cube+ dataset

Cube+ is large enough to test DNN-based models and have I re-processed it into *tiff* and *json* format.

## 3. Pixel-wise dataset: LSMI dataset


The original LSMI dataset is too large, making it time-consuming to process. I have re-processed one of the **Sony** datasets for faster model checking.
